 This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project.  

## Acknowledgement
- Udacity DLND and DSND.

## Motivation
I will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, My algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If an image of a human is supplied, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.



## Project Parts
   -  Import Datasets
   - Detect Humans
   - Detect Dogs
   - Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
   - Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
   - Write My Algorithm
   - Test My Algorithm
